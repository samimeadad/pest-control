                                Cockroaches are becoming far more common within more urban areas; attending call-outs to exterminate cockroaches throughout the UK is now routine for Eliminate’s Technicians. Cockroaches are a nuisance and health risk in various industrial and domestic settings throughout the UK.

                                Two common types of cockroaches reside in the UK. These are Oriental cockroaches (Blatta Orientalis) and German cockroaches (Blattella Germanica).

                            <p className='text-start'>
                                The German cockroach is the more commonly found one of the two and can be found worldwide. These pests can be found in almost every human-occupied space, but they tend to be increased in numbers where there are restaurants, hotels and other food facilities.

                            <p className='text-start'>
                                The oriental cockroach is also commonly referred to as a waterbug or black beetle and is the larger of the two species. You tend to find them near sewers and other damp areas. Despite its name, it is believed they originate from Africa.

                                Cockroaches can carry harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and E-Coli which they can transfer to a human host. Both bacteria can cause food poisoning and be dangerous to humans who consume infected food. Cockroaches can also be an asthma trigger.

                                They can be invasive and enter your home for warmth, food and water. They can enter through just about any gap in your house, such as air vents, under the doors and windows. It is advisable not to handle a cockroach as it can trigger an allergic reaction.

                                Our Cockroach programmes use a knockdown spray to remove as many of these unwanted pests as possible in one go.   The spray we use not only kills the eggs, adult and juvenile (nymph) cockroaches on contact with the insect but will also remain active for some time after the initial spray treatment. In conjunction with this, we will also treat the affected area with an edible poison in a gel form, which will round up any cockroaches that the initial spray may miss.
                            </p>

                                Cockroaches are very resilient pests and are tough to eradicate. Their ability to breed rapidly makes cockroach pest removal services even more vital. If you can catch the infestation quickly enough, it will be easier to manage the situation. Eliminate Solutions has only the best elimination equipment to handle any size cockroach infestation.

                                Cockroaches can damage a commercial premises’ reputation, mainly if it is related to food. In addition, cockroaches are well known to carry several diseases, which can lead to illnesses such as food poisoning, tapeworm, dysentery, fungus, roundworm and other viruses and allergies.
                            </p>
                            <p className='text-start mb-5'>
                                Cockroaches also carry an unpleasant odour, which can be offputting in a food-related environment. A single cockroach might not have such a pungent smell, but an infestation might overwhelm the building. In addition, they carry a sweet, musty smell that is likened to almonds. This is usually a good telltale sign that you have cockroaches.

                            Inspect your home for hiding places in warm or dark areas or near where there are food sources and water. Ensure you always clean your house of crumbs and dampness whenever possible to remove the temptation of the cockroach moving in. You can also lay a few sticky traps in suspect areas to try and catch them yourself. Try and discover entry points into your home and fill those gaps to prevent entry. Repair cracks in walls, refill the edges of windows with caulk and repair any water leaks you may have.
