                            <p className='text-start'>
                                Flies are a health risk. They are attracted to decaying organic matter. Flies eat by regurgitating digestive juices onto the food source thus liquefying it, then sucking it up, taking with it any bacteria present. As they fly from rotting meat or animal droppings, then onto food for human consumption, they carry bacteria with them. They then go onto spreading disease wither from further regurgitation or in their faeces (known as fly-spotting). As well as carrying gastroenteritis, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis, they can bring with them intestinal worms and their eggs.

                        <p className='text-start mb-5 mt-3'>
                            There are different types of flies and they can be a nuisance around the home. The common housefly is around 6mm long with a wingspan of 13-15mm and 4 stripes on its back. There is also a lesser house fly, which is of a similar size but has three stripes on its back, two of them yellow.
                        </p>
                        <p className='text-start mb-5'>
                            The blue and green bottle flies both resemble the common housefly (the green bottle is usually a little bigger), but they can be distinguished by their vibrant metallic colour.
                        </p>
                        <p className='text-start mb-5'>
                            Adult fruit flies are around 3mm in length, the front part of the body is tan and the rear section black and they have red eyes.
                        </p>
                        <p className='text-start mb-5'>
                            Unfortunately, if you have a problem with blowflies, it could signify another pest infestation as they breed exclusively on dead animals and there may be a dead rodent or bird somewhere in your property (under floorboards, behind a cupboard, or in the loft). In this case, you will usually notice a bad smell too as the carcass will have been there for one or two weeks before you see evidence of blowflies.
